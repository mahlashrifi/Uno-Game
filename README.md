## About Uno

Uno is a card game which originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins.

The aim of the game is to be the first player to finish its cards. In turn, play one card matching the discard in color, or number of the card on the deck. There are some other rules which you can find them in  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game))*.*
